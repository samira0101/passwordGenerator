# generatePasswordJS
The motivation behind this very first JavaScript file is so that the webpage becomes interactive with the user.

Having given a starter code with HTML and CSS meant that the display and layout were visable on the webapage. However, in order to make the service interactive it requires an addition file which is where JavaScript comes into play. 

The more I practised whilst updating the webspage go live, I could understand certain concepts in which was hard to understand just by theory. 

Unfortnatly, I was able to get the box with the questions and its 'returns' on cosole but just not on the actual webpage.
